# V-Model
## What is V model with example?
* In software development, the V-model represents a development process that may be considered an extension of the waterfall model. 
* It is an example of the more general V-model. 
* Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape.
