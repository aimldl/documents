# V-Model
* In software development, the V-model represents a development process that may be considered an extension of the waterfall model. 
* It is an example of the more general V-model. 
* Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape.

* The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing.
* The horizontal and vertical axes represents time or project completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain abstraction uppermost), respectively.
* The V-model of the Systems Engineering Process
