### Embedding in Japanese
Google search: japanese embedding

* [Japanese Word2Vec](https://github.com/philipperemy/japanese-words-to-vectors)
* [Word vectors for 157 languages](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html)
  * Pre-trained word vectors for 157 languages, trained on Common Crawl and Wikipedia using fastText.
  * For example, English. Korean, Japanese, and Chinese are all supported!
  * Tokenization
    * Chinese -> Stanford word segmenter
    * Japanese -> Mecab
    * Vietnamese -> UETsegmenter
    * For languages using the Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew or Greek scripts -> the tokenizer from the Europarl preprocessing tools
    * For the remaining languages -> ICU tokenizer.
* [IDEA] Embedding with Aozora Bunko wasn't found from my short search result.
