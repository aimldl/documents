### 크로스 플랫폼 프레임워크와 툴

어떤 프로그래밍 언어로 애플리케이션을 만들 것인가? 크로스 플랫폼 솔루션 대부분은 하나의 프로그래밍 언어만 지원한다. 프레임워크, 모바일 개발에 프로그래밍 언어까지 동시에 배워야 하는 부담스러운 상황을 피하려면 쓸 줄 아는 언어를 지원하는 크로스 플랫폼 솔루션을 선택하는 게 좋다. [p.305, 23장. 모바일 개발, "커리어 스킬", 존 손메즈]

As a result of reading the above articles, I wasn't able to reach a single best cross-platform framework for mobile app development. Xamarin seems to be a pretty good choice and it uses C#. 

### Question

How easy is C# compared to C++ (which I'm familiar with)?

### C#

[C# Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/index.htm)

C# programming is very much based on C and C++ programming languages, so if you have a basic understanding of C or C++ programming, then it will be fun to learn C#.

### Xamarin

* An app platform for building Android and iOS apps with .NET and C#.

* Free. Cross-platform. Open source. 

* Develop on Windows and macOS

![I prefer Ubuntu to Windows or macOS simply because my development environment is set to Ubuntu 18.04 on multiple devices. I can work seamlessly across multiple devices at office, home, cafe and so on. Windows is my second choice, but Windows 10 is fine for me.]
