### Mobile apps vs. web apps: The pros and cons

#### Native mobile apps

**Pros:**

- Faster than web apps
- Greater functionality as they have access to system resources
- Can work offline
- Safe and secure — native apps must first be approved by the app store
- Easier to build due to the availability of developer tools, interface elements and SDKs

**Cons:**

- More expensive to build than web apps
- Compatibility with different platforms (i.e. iOS and Android) usually means designing and building the app from scratch
- Expensive to maintain and update
- It may prove difficult to get a native app approved by the app store

#### Web apps


**Pros:**

- Do not need to be downloaded or installed — web apps function in-browser
- Easy to maintain — they have a common codebase regardless of mobile platform
- Will update themselves
- Quicker and easier to build than mobile apps
- Do not require app store approval, so can be launched quickly

**Cons:**

- Do not work offline
- Slower than mobile apps, and less advanced in terms of features
- May not be as discoverable as mobile apps as they are not listed in a specific database, such as the app store
- Quality and security is not always guaranteed — web apps don’t need to be approved by the app store
