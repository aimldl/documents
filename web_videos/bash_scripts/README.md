### README.md
This directory has several utility programs to process web videos.

This directory is supposed to be a subset of "aimldl > computing_environments > bash > scripts". Only relevant scripts are selectively copied to this directory for convenience.

#### TODO
##### 2019-12-12 (Thu)
Write a Bash script that renames missing file names in order.
I deleted IMG_8927-500-60.PNG and IMG_8922-500_60.PNG.
So I have renamed all the file names from IMG_8928-500-60.PNG
  because it makes things easier eventually. That is,

> IMG_8928-500-60.PNG -> IMG_8927-500-60.PNG
IMG_8929-500-60.PNG -> IMG_8928-500-60.PNG
  ...

Let's automate this.
