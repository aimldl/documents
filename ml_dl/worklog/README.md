# Dos & Don'ts for Worklog
Worklog is a log used to keep track of work that has been done. [wikitionary.org](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/worklog). The following "Dos & Don'ts" is based off of [How to create a work log](https://fyr.ndla.no/en/teachingprogramme/7470).

## Don't write down
* make a to-do list in your work log.
* worry about something not important.
* recount every second of your day.
## Do write down
* when & what task is received and completed.
  - by whom (name & title)
  - when (day, date and time).
* what you've done and when.
  - when you gave the subsequent instructions to whom.
* only the important information such as:
  - work tools (what & how)
  - work process (what & how)
* a short summary of the log.

## Tips
* Keep a worklog weekly, not daily. Focus on the work itself, not on the documentation. +Added on 2020-03-06 (Fri).
