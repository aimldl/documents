# Infrared Camera

* 밤에는 일반 카메라의 성능이 저하된다.

* 밤에도 비둘기를 검출하기 위해선 적외선 카메라가 도움이 될 수 있다.

* Q: 창문 안에 있어도 적외선 카메라가 잘 동작할 것인가?

  A: No. 성능을 더 높이려면 창문에 바짝 붙여야 한다. 그러므로 창문이 있는 베란다 안쪽보다는 바깥쪽에 설치하는 편이 성능을 높일 수 있다.

[Do Security Cameras Work through Glass or behind a Glass Window](https://reolink.com/security-cameras-through-behind-window-glass/#:~:text=Infrared%20security%20cameras%20are%20prone,able%20to%20see%20things%20clearly.)

> **Do Infrared Security Cameras See through Glass/Window?**
>
> Infrared security cameras are prone to wash out the picture when placing behind glass or window glass panels at night or in low light conditions. In those scenarios, you won't be able to see things clearly.
>
> **Fixes:**
>
> To prevent glare on a surveillance camera looking through a window, users could **turn off or disable IR lights** as well as status lights at night, which helps mitigate IR security camera window reflection and enable you to see through glass or glass window screen.
>
> Meanwhile, to reduce window glare and reflection, **get the camera lens as close as possible against the glass** when placed behind a glass window.
>
> Or using a **suction cup mount** that sticks to the window facing outside, for example, [this suction cup mount](https://www.amazon.com/Versatile-Suction-Mount-Wasserstein-Outdoor/dp/B06XK6PV6J/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=reolinkblog-20) even comes with a magnetic screw mount that allows it to attach to the outdoor cams like Nest cam.
>
> Installing a **motion-activated or automated external lights** like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Innovations-40218-Motion-Activated-Security-Spotlight/dp/B001U2D6OO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=reolinkblog-20) or street lamp outside helps light up the front door or backyard, which provides illumination for security cameras to see more details.

> **Does Motion Detection/Recording Work through Glass or behind a Glass Window?**
>
> There are two main types of motion sensors used in security cameras/systems. One is a motion sensor that triggers alerts by **measuring changes in pixels**, which relies on software algorithm, for example, [Reolink C1 Pro](https://reolink.com/product/c1-pro/), [Reolink RLC-410](https://reolink.com/product/rlc-410/).
>
> Another is the **passive Infrared motion sensor** that sets off motion alarms by detecting body heat and infrared energy, known as PIR motion sensor, such as [Reolink Argus 2](https://reolink.com/product/argus-2/), NETGEAR Arlo.
>
> Security cameras with a motion sensor that calculates changes in pixels will still be able to detect movement and record through glass or a glass window.
>
> PIR motion sensor security camera doesn't t work reliably or sometimes doesn't work at all through windows or glass because most glasses used in modern houses today are insulated, limiting heat coming through the glass, which in return undermine motion detection.
>
> **Fixes:**
>
> To detect motion and record motions through glass or a glass window, **placing the camera outside**, **mounting the camera on the wall or window ledge**, **installing them under a soffit or overhang**.
>
> For example, installing [wire-free security camera](https://store.reolink.com/battery-security-cameras/) outside on the wall to keep an eye on areas of interest.
