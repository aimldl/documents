### What is GCA (General Cognitive Ability)?

> Cognitive ability is defined as a general mental capability involving reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, complex idea comprehension, and learning from experience (Gottfredson, 1997). ... Cognitive ability is widely considered the best predictor of job performance (Schmidt and Hunter, 1998).

### Cognitive Ability and Intelligence

According to "Is intelligence a cognitive ability?" in Google's "People also ask", human intelligence has a lot to do with cognitive ability.
> Human intelligence is the intellectual power of humans, which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self-awareness. Intelligence enables humans to remember descriptions of things and use those descriptions in future behaviors.

> It is a cognitive process. It gives humans the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, understand, and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, comprehend ideas, plan, solve problems, and use language to communicate. Intelligence enables humans to experience and think.

In other words, how smart a person is measured by the cognitive ability. Therefore General Cognitive Abitliy or GCA is a jargon (in psychology or cognitive science) to measure the human intelligence in general. Simply put, how smart a person is in general is described by GCA.

### Cognitive Skills
Two answers in "People also ask" are quoted below. Both sets of cognitive skills are termed differently, but may mean essentially the same skills. However it's worth listing both cognitive skill sets.

#### What are the different cognitive abilities?
Cognitive skills are the core skills your brain uses to think, read, learn, remember, reason, and pay attention. Working together, they take incoming information and move it into the bank of knowledge you use every day at school, at work, and in life.
