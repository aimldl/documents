## 2020, Year of the Rat
### 01-26 (Sun), 15:45pm, Home Dining Table
It's been the fourth day since I bought a book "Career Skills" by John Sonmez. I'm reading the book and found many parts are helpful to my career. I'll record the changes in my career life by applying what I've learned from this book.

The book was bought two days before the lunar new year. Today is the second day in the lunar calendar. So it's like my new year's resolution to learn and apply the principles in the book. In Korean saying, "Resolutions won't last three days." Now my first goal is not to quit in three days.

Here is what I'm going to do for three days.
1. Use a Pomodoro Technique when I keep a journal.
  * Set a timer for 25 minutes and finish writing it.
  * Don't be a perfectionist. Just be consistent.
2. Manage my project. Become a project manager myself.
  * Install, configure, and familiarize myself a project management tool.
  * Compare and decide which tool to use ProjectLibre or GanttProject.
  * Use this tool to keep track of any work if it takes more than two days.
3. Find a way to complete a learning cycle.
  * Set a goal
  * Plan how to learn
  * Read and study the material.
  * Do hands-on and write down the questions.
  * Let the curiosity be the guide and answer the questions one-by-one.
  * Teach others; summarize what I've learned and teach them.

[It's 16:09pm. Time to wrap up.]

I'm going to use a trick to achieve my first goal. I will consider today is the second day. Tomorrow is an official holiday. The last day of the lunar new year's holidays. I'll have to go to the office the day after tomorrow. It's less likely I'll get this new things done. By tomorrow, I'll have freedom of doing whatever I want to do. So let's see if I can do it when I have lots of freedom. The first hurdle will be overcome.

16:15pm. Let's finish it. Well-done!
