## What is NLP?
NLP is a field of study about an ability of machine or computer to process human language. Processing human language by computer consists, mainly, of two parts: processing text and processing speech. The field of study dealing with text is NLP or Natural Language Processing while speech is covered by Speech Signal Processing. NLP is divided largely by NLU (Natural Language Understanding) and NLG (Natural Language Generation). Several examples of real world NLP applications are Smart Speaker, Intelligent Personal Assistant, Spam Filtering, and Sentiment Analysis. To sum, NLP processes text data to understand and generate human language.
