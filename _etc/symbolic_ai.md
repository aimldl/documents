# Symbolic AI

Q: Can I call a communication systems that uses rules a symbolic AI?

A: My preliminary answer is no. It is NOT artificial intelligence because it is not about how human brain works implemented in rules. 

= Classical AI,

> In addition, areas that rely on procedural or implicit knowledge such as sensory/motor processes, are much more difficult to handle within the Symbolic AI framework.
