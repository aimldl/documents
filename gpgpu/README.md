## What is GPU?

> * A GPU is a programmable processor on which thousands of processing cores run simultaneously in massive parallelism, where each core is focused on making efficient calculations, facilitating real-time processing and analysis of enormous datasets. 
>
> * GPUs were originally designed primarily for the purpose of rendering images. 
> * GPGPUs can now be programmed to direct that processing power toward addressing scientific computing needs as well.

## What is GPGPU?

> * GPGPU also know as GPGPU computing
>
> * A General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (**GPGPU**) is a graphics processing unit (GPU) that is programmed for purposes beyond graphics processing, such as performing computations typically conducted by a Central Processing Unit (CPU).
>
> * Incorporating GPUs for general purposes enhances CPU architecture by accelerating portions of an application while the rest continues to run on the CPU, ultimately creating an overall faster, high-performance application by combining CPU and GPU processing power

## GPU vs GPGPU

> Essentially all modern GPUs are GPGPUs. 
>
> * If a graphics card or a GPU card is compatible with any particular framework that provides access to general purpose computation, it is a GPGPU. 
> * The primary difference is that where GPU computing is a hardware component, GPGPU is fundamentally a software concept in which specialized programming and equipment designs facilitate massive parallel processing of non-specialized calculations.
