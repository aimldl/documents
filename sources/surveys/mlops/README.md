# MLOPs (Machine Learning OPerations)
MLOps considers the following areas (barriers) to optimize workflows and avoid issues during implementation.
* Deployment
* Automation
* Reproducibility of models and predictions
* Scalability
* Collaboration
* Diagnostics
* Monitoring and management
* Governance and regulatory compliance
* Business uses

MLOPs is a practice 
* for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals
* to help manage production machine learning lifecycle.
(As deep learning is a sub-set of machine learning, deep learning lifecycle is also included in MLOps.)

MLOps applies to the entire lifecycle
* model generation (software development lifecycle, continuous integration/continuous delivery),
* orchestration, 
* deployment,
* health,
* diagnostics,
* governance,
* business metrics.
