## [Building a Data Science Portfolio: Storytelling with Data](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-portfolio-project/)

The following part is the summary of excerpts from an article [Building a Data Science Portfolio: Storytelling with Data](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-portfolio-project/).

### Overview

This is the first post in a series that will cover how to make a well-rounded data science portfolio. In this post, we’ll cover how to make your first project for a data science portfolio, and how to tell an effective story using data. At the end, you’ll have a project that will help demonstrate your ability to communicate, and your ability to reason about data.

### Why Data Science Portfolio?

* Data science companies are increasingly looking at portfolios when making hiring decisions.

* One of the reasons for this is that a portfolio is the best way to judge someone’s real-world skills.

* The good news for you is that a portfolio is entirely within your control.
* If you put some work in, you can make a great portfolio that companies are impressed by.

### Skills to Demonstrate

The first step in making a high-quality portfolio is to know what skills to demonstrate. The primary skills they want a portfolio to demonstrate are:

- Ability to communicate
- Ability to collaborate with others
- Technical competence
- Ability to reason about data
- Motivation and ability to take initiative

Any good portfolio will be composed of multiple projects, each of which may demonstrate 1-2 of the above points. 

### Storytelling with data

Jupyter notebook

* The best tool to effectively tell a story with data is [Jupyter notebook](http://www.jupyter.org/). 
* We’ll use Jupyter notebook, along with Python libraries like Pandas and matplotlib in this post.

### Choosing a topic for your data science project

* You want the topic to be something you’re interested in, and are motivated to explore. 
* It’s worth spending extra time on this step, so ensure that you find something you’re actually interested in.

* A good way to find a topic is to browse different datasets and seeing what looks interesting.
* Some good sites to start with:
  * Kaggle
  * [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) — contains government data.
  * [/r/datasets](https://reddit.com/r/datasets) — a subreddit that has hundreds of interesting datasets.
  * [Awesome datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) — a list of datasets, hosted on Github.
  * [17 places to find datasets](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects/) — a blog post with 17 data sources, and example datasets from each.
* In real-world data science, you often won’t find a nice single dataset that you can browse.

### Pick a topic

* It’s easier to add to a finished project than to complete a project that you just can’t seem to ever get enough motivation to finish.

### Portfolio vs. Project

A Portfolio is defined as the group of projects you’re showcasing in your job application, regardless of the format in which they’re presented.

* For entry-level positions, the project portfolio is where the rubber meets the road.

* In fact, if you don’t have previous experience in the data science field, your portfolio of projects is probably what will determine whether you get that all-important call back for an interview. 
* Projects often play a crucial role in the interview phase as well.

### Why Data Science Projects Are Crucial

#### You need experience

* **Employers won’t pay you to do something you’ve never done before. ** That’s a fundamental rule of the labor market in any industry, and data science is no exception.
* It’s quite logical, really: would you visit the restaurant of a chef who’d never cooked before? Or step onto a plane flown by a pilot who’d never been up in the air before? Probably not.
* Whether you’re transitioning into data science from full-time study, some other career, or simply trying to get a *different* kind of data science job, you’re going to need experience. 

* Even for entry-level positions, if doing a job requires skill, **you need to be able to show you *can* do it before anyone will pay you to do it.**
* But most entry-level applicants have little or no professional experience in data science. So how can you prove that you’ve got the skills the job requires? Portfolio projects. 
* A portfolio of projects takes the place of that work experience in your job applications. It shows potential employers that you really *can* do the kind of data science work you’re applying for.

* In fact, **projects might be the single most important part of your application**, because they crop up at every stage of the process.

  * They will be mentioned on your resume, linked in your application, 

    and you can expect them to play an important role in many job interviews, too.

  * Most of the recruiters we spoke to while creating this guide said that they reviewed projects and portfolios when screening candidates,

    but they talked about the projects in interviews, too.

* For example, Michael Hupp describes the first stage of data science interviews at his company:

  * “We just ask them about their projects. We’ll try and quiz them on the technical skills, but we also want to make sure they’re able to talk about the project, and the results, in an understandable way.”

* Recruiters told us that they sometimes use projects to gauge everything from a candidate’s technical abilities to their level of passion for the subject matter. Without prior professional experience in the field, you’ll probably have to lean heavily on your projects at various stages of the hiring process, so it’s vitally important you get them right.

#### What Your Portfolio Needs to Demonstrate

Precisely what you need to demonstrate with your portfolio is going to depend on the job you’re applying for.

* Someone who’s looking for data analyst positions in marketing should have a portfolio of projects highlighting marketing-related analytical skills.
* Someone who’s looking for a machine learning engineer position had better have a portfolio of impressive machine learning projects.
* the mantra to remember is this:
  * *your portfolio should prove you can do the work.*
    * The ability to communicate
    * The ability to collaborate with others
    * Technical competence (skills)
    * The ability to reason about data
    * The motivation and ability to take initiative

* “The point of a portfolio, and in large part the guiding principle of the entire application process, is being able to prove that you did work in a way that can be easily verified,

*  “If you choose to show off something that is commonly done and has existing tutorials out there already, it is very difficult for me as a hiring manager to evaluate whether you have actually done a bunch of work and thought, or whether you’ve simply followed along with a generic tutorial.”

#### Projects to Include in a Data Science Portfolio

* A data science portfolio should consist of 3-5 projects that showcase your job-relevant skills.
* Again, the goal here is to prove you can do the work, so the more your portfolio looks like the day-to-day work of the jobs you’re applying for, the more convincing it’s going to be.
* [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) CEO and co-founder Refael “Rafi” Zikavashvili
  * “Don’t pick just random projects to work on and add it to your resume or portfolio”
* “Solve a problem that relates to the companies that you’re interested in.”

* This applies to
  * the *kinds of tasks* you’re taking on in your projects, but also 
  * the *subject areas* your projects examine, and
  * the *types of data sets* you’re working with.

#### Three factors
