# KBPedia

* [KBpedia](http://kbpedia.org/) is a comprehensive knowledge structure for promoting data interoperability and knowledge-based artificial intelligence, or [KBAI](http://www.mkbergman.com/category/kbai/).
* The KBpedia knowledge structure combines seven (7) public knowledge bases — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia), [Wikidata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata), [schema.org](https://schema.org/), [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org/), [GeoNames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoNames), [OpenCyc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc), and standard [UNSPSC products and services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSPSC) — into an integrated whole.

##### What is a 'knowledge graph'?

A 'knowledge graph' is an ontology; that is, an organized network of related and interconnected concepts. Specific things (or objects) in the given domain are represented as nodes in the graph, with edges or connections between those nodes representing the relationships between things. Knowledge graphs (ontologies), if organized in a coherent and consistent manner, may be reasoned over and used to select and inspect related things.

##### So is KBAI somehow related to all of this?

Absolutely. Knowledge-based artificial intelligence has the ideal of massively labeled, logical reasonable, and coherently organized knowledge structures and language. [*The What is KBAI?*](https://kbpedia.org/docs/what-is-kbai) page describes how these kinds of "feature rich" knowledge bases help promote both supervised and unsupervised learning, and are also good substrates for deep learning. Moreover, KBAI knowledge structures also lend themselves to quicker and more effective mapping to external schema and data.

##### How big is KBpedia?

There is no single, agreed-upon metric for measuring the size of knowledge bases. Nonetheless, we try to capture the size of KBpedia through a number of measures, as shown on the [KBpedia statistics](https://kbpedia.org/resources/statistics) page. There are 58,000 reference concepts, 40 million entities, 3.5+ billion direct assertions, and nearly 7 billion inferred facts on KBpedia.

**Open Standards: W3C** 

KBpedia uses open semantic Web and linked data standards from the World Wide Web Consortium, notably RDF, RDFS, OWL2, SPARQL, SKOS and SWRL; we write most code and data structs in Clojure
