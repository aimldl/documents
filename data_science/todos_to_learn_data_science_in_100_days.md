# TODOs to Learn Data Science in 100 Days

## Overview

The presented to-do list is from an article [A Complete Guide to Learn Data Science in 100 Days](https://medium.com/swlh/a-complete-guide-to-learn-data-science-in-100-days-8c6557154102), Sharan Kumar Ravindran, Medium which explains the strategy to learn what and when in 100 days. The schedule is quite tight. Practically, this schedule is more to review the topics, not to learn them from scratch. While the timeline is impractical, it's better to have the strategy and a reference timeline.

## The to-do list
